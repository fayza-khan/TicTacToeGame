# Tic-Tac-Toe 
Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe game. Created a Tic Tac Toe game as a project in Python 3. Have fun!

## Description
Tic-tac-toe , noughts and crosses, or Xs and Os, is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. It is a solved game with a forced draw assuming best play from both players.

## How to play
- The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
- Two players are supposed to give their names and the character(X or 0) of their choice. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
- The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
- When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.
- You can play the game again if desired.

## About the project
### Programming Language used:
- Python 3
## Notes:
- This script is an interactive guessing game, which will ask the both the users to fill in the grid.
- We are using the random module to decide the first turn.
